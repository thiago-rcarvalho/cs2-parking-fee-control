Parking Fee Control is a mod that lets you manage parking fees for buildings, helping you keep rates always up-to-date and exactly as you want!

After installing it, you'll see a Parking icon on the top-left side of the screen. Click it to access the fees screen.

Features:
* Customize fees for multiple parking lots (values range from 0 to 50). Fees can be applied instantly via the configuration panel and also periodically, as configured.
* Periodically updates the fees for parking lots added to the map during gameplay, keeping everything consistent.
* You can ignore fee application for parking lots that have the following tags in their name: [nofee], [npf], or |npf|. Just add one of these tags to the building's name.
* Since this mod does not alter your save, it can be added or removed at any time without issues.
* Compatible with Vanilla parking lots and many other mods (see list below).
* Supported languages: en-us, pt-br (contribute with translations on the project's GitHub)


Parking Fee Control is currently in BETA. Bugs may occur; fee application performance is still being validated, but so far no bottlenecks have been observed.

## Technical Notes
1. Since it was difficult to find an automatic way to detect parking lot mods, I chose a simpler approach: mods are mapped directly in the code. If your favorite parking mod is not yet supported, just open a pull request or an issue on the project's GitHub. The README contains all necessary information.
2. Periodic updates may be removed in the future if I find a way to intercept the placement of parking lots and change the default fee before the player places them on the map. Still working on it;
